Do: Install Processing on your computer from the Processing.org site If you are new to Processing: Do the following tutorials from the Processing tutorial page and bring to class: - "Getting Started" - "Coordinate System and Shapes" - "Color" Optional: - Watch some of the "Hello Processing" tutorial videos with Daniel Shiffman  If you are experienced with Processing: Do a tutorial on one of the following concepts (assigned to you in class): variables, conditionals, for loops, arrays -- incorporating one of the following: song, dance, sculpture, drawing or storytelling. Aim for clarity: a novice to programming should be able to get the concept implicitly from your tutorial. This takes time and planning to do well.
